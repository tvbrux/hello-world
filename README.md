My first repo
****************
Hi there,

I'm Thijs, a physical therapist and clinical health scientist (expected june 2016). I've always had a passion for tech and decided I want to have a career in the field of ICT. So I started reading about programming languages and doing some short courses on Codecademy. That gave me some satisfaction but I felt I wanted more and wanted the real deal.
So I started the OSS course. I don't have a job in ICT but that is my goal.
I'm not looking for a full degree in computer science, but a thorough understanding of programming. 

My hope is that I can make the career switch within a year from now on.

Well, talk to you later.

Kind regards.
